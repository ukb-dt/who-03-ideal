Variants:
- Smoking THC:
   - Oral
   - Pharynx (Minimize Flow Rate)
   - Mucosa (Upper vs Lower Airways) => $dE_x/dt = 0 (min)$
   - Breath (Flow) vs Cough (Turbulence)
   - Ciculation -> Brain (CB1 Receptors)
- Decision Support => KPIs (Bidrectional, Supply-Demand):
   - Data/Oracle $(E, x)$
   - Analysis/Microsoft $(E(t \mid x + \epsilon)$
   - Rate/Nvidia GPUs (parallel vs series) $dE_x/dt$
   - Inferences/OpenAI Neuronetworks $dE_{\bar{x}}/dt \pm \sqrt{d^2E_x/dt^2}$
   - UI-UX/Value (Delta MarketCap) $\int E_x dt + \epsilon t + C_x$
- Generalization (Path-Dependencies)
   - Undifferentiated
   - Differentiated
   - Rate
   - Exploration/Boundaries
   - Tailored
